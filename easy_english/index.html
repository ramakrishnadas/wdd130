                <p>Most English courses for beginners focus on teaching grammar rules and verb tenses. Unfortunately, this approach is quite unnatural. Ask yourself how infants learn to talk. You never see a mother teaching grammar rules to her one-year-old child. This is because it's not natural to learn to talk like that. We just end up saturating our brains with countless rules, exceptions to those rules, verb tenses, etc., and when the time to talk comes, our brain feels overwhelmed trying to build properly structured sentences while considering all of the rules and exceptions it learned. With our EasyEnglish course, we offer a different approach. Our approach focuses on teaching our students English vocabulary on topics of their interest as well as general topics that are often used in everyday conversations. Additionally, we also gradually teach our students how to build sentences more dynamically. Listening to videos, podcasts, and music in English is also a very helpful way of expanding your vocabulary so that you begin to communicate more efficiently (and less mechanically) in English. We use memory games and visual and practical activities to make it easier for students to understand the context of the lessons and all of the new words that they're hearing, which usually sound like gibberish at first.</p>

                        <li>- No more headaches trying to learn complicated rules and their exceptions (and trying to apply them while building sentences in a completely new language).</li>
                        <li>- A gradual learning curve that will actually enable you to engage in conversation with people confidently.</li>
                        <li>- You will obtain a general knowledge of the English language, and most importantly, you will apply most of the grammar rules without even knowing.</li>
