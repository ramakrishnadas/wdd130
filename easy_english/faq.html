                <h4>What's the minimum age to enroll in this course?</h4>
                <p>We teach people older than 12 years old. We are also working on an EasyEnglish course for children (4 to 11 years old). We will provide the information of this course once we have everything set up.</p>

                <h4>What is the duration of the course?</h4>
                <p>The course's duration is three months. However, if any student still has trouble achieving the expected results, they may stay longer. Our priority is to enable you to maintain simple conversations in English.</p>

                <h4>What do I need to enroll?</h4>
                <p>All you need to enroll in our EasyEnglish course is a computer and a stable Internet connection. We also recommend using a web camera and a good headset so that we can see and hear you as you practice your English.</p>

                <h4>How are the lessons taught?</h4>
                <p>The lessons are taught online. We have Zoom meetings with our students and teach them with different activities. We also send exclusive digital material (text, audio, and video) to our students so that they can practice their conversational English. We give everyone an opportunity to grow confident enough to talk in English, and we also encourage students to speak in English with each other.</p>
