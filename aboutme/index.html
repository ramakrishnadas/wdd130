    <p>Hello, everyone. Happy new year! I am currently working as a freelance translator of the English/Spanish language pair. This job has helped me maintain myself for a few years. However, I'm currently studying Web & Computer Programming at BYU-Idaho, and I'm looking forward to learning a lot about this field of knowledge.</p>
    <p>Once I graduate, I expect to work as a freelance software developer or programmer. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to study online at BYU-Idaho, and I've already learned so much, so I'm sure there's a lot more to learn here.</p>
